Clustering News Articles
This project uses clustering techniques to group news articles based on their content. The goal is to identify patterns and similarities in the articles, which could provide insights into trends and themes in the news.

Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have Python installed, along with the following packages:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
BeautifulSoup
You can install these packages using pip or another package manager.

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can run the clustering algorithm on a set of news articles. The input should be a collection of text files, each containing the text of a single article.

The output of the clustering algorithm will be a set of clusters, each containing a group of similar articles.

Clustering Algorithm
The clustering algorithm used in this project is based on the k-means clustering algorithm. The algorithm works by iteratively assigning each article to the cluster with the closest centroid, and then updating the centroids based on the articles in each cluster.

The number of clusters is determined using the elbow method, which involves running the clustering algorithm for a range of cluster numbers and selecting the number that produces the most significant reduction in the sum of squared distances between the articles and their centroids.

Data Sources
For this project, we used a collection of news articles from BBC news articles. The articles were collected using web scraping techniques which i downloaded them from kaggle.com, and then preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to remove stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant data.
